# Neovim configuration

![Neovim Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neovim-57A143?style=for-the-badge&logo=neovim&logoColor=57A143&labelColor=black)

My personal Neovim configuration with some useful plugins, themes, and settings that you can use if you want to (I don't see why would anyone do that).

## Requirements

 - Neovim v0.9 (That's what I used in this setup, might work with older versions).
 - Plugin manager [`lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).
 - Any of the patched [`Nerd Font`](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

## Installation
 - Clone this repo and place the `init.lua` file into the neovim config directory (e.g, `~\.config\nvim\`).
