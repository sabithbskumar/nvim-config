# Neovim configuration

![Neovim Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neovim-57A143?style=for-the-badge&logo=neovim&logoColor=57A143&labelColor=black)

My personal Neovim configuration with some useful plugins, themes, and settings that you can use if you want to (I don't see why would anyone do that).

## Requirements

 - Neovim v0.9 (That's what I use, check what is the minimum requirement for treesitter plugin).
 - Plugin manager `vim-plug`.

## Installation
 - Simply clone this repo and copy `vim.init` file to the neovim config directory (e.g, `~\.config\nvim\`).
